UniArchive is a cross-platform solution for importing Instant Messaging
(IM) archives from a variety of clients (e.g. Yahoo, Digsby, etc.) into
a unified SQLite-based format, as well as browsing through the resulting
unified archive.

Currently UniArchive can import from the following clients:

- Yahoo Messenger
- MSN Messenger
- Digsby
- Pidgin (aka GAIM)

Note that UniArchive intentionally seeks to only preserve that
information which is most important and supported by all clients. As
such, fancy formatting is removed, and only the smileys are kept apart
from the actual conversation text.

While UniArchive is designed to try to work around the brokenness of
some of the formats, as well as make educated guesses and consult you
when appropriate, there is no guarantee that it will perform an
error-free conversion. Users are advised to also keep copies of the
IM archives in their original format.
